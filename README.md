Project description
-------------------
Keeping an overview of your garage sale can be challenging:
 - 'In which box did I place the red handbag?'
 - 'How much did I earn up until now?'
 - 'Have I already sold the kitchen balance?' etc.

With this notebook it will be easy for you to create your own 'garage sale' database and answer all your questions in no time without messing with excel. 

Project Milestones
-------------------
### Milestone 1
Creating the database structure and fill in available information.

 ### Milestone 2
 Modifying and updating database with changed information.
 
 ### Milestone 3
 Queries to answer questions on the status quo.
